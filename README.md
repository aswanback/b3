# Bulletin!

React Native app that aims to rejuvenate the bulletin board by taking it virtual and adding mapping, calendars, and other features that bring the irrelevant, once seen posters in class buildings back to life, with a pilot version for Purdue University.
 
This app is unfortunately unfinished as a competitor emerged that had far more experience and a timing head start just as we returned to school for a difficult semester.
